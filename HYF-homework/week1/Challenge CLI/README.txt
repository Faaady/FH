1 . I can create an hidden folder by create a repository using Git , by the code : git init , and so , any file wich i will create inside 
this repository will be also hidden . 

2.  I  can  create multiple nested directories by creating more than one directory and move from directory to another :
mkdir HYF-homework  , mkdir week1 , mkdir challeng-CLI . then cd HYF-homework , cd week1 , cd challeng-CLI .
and then I will have multiple nested directories :  ~/Desktop/HYF-homework/week1/challeng-CLI (master)


3  I append a message to a file without a newline character by using the codes : echo and echo -n 
firt I append the string to the file using : echo <somthing>  and secondly I display the string without newline using echo -n .
